Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains a Speech Emotion Recognition project using the TESS dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze and classify emotional tones in speech using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python as a Jupyter Notebook.

Features
Dataset: Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), a widely-used dataset for emotion recognition tasks.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing includes feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs) and augmentation techniques.
Modeling: Deep learning models implemented using libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.
Visualization: Visual insights into data distribution and model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy/loss graphs).
Evaluation: Performance metrics to validate emotion classification accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
LibROSA (for audio feature extraction)
Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook speech_emotion_recognition.ipynb
